We've made your membership of @(organ.displayName)'s organisation on GitHub non-public, to make it less likely an attacker can find it.

Once you've addressed the requirements above, you (and [only](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) you) can [re-publicise your membership](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership) if it's appropriate.
